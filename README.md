DELICIOUS INDIAN STREET FOOD – PAV BHAJI
An incredibly tasty street food from Mumbai – a friend who worked in the kitchen with us Yamini is from Delhi and always loved this dish and inspired us to do our version – it's a beautiful mashed vegetable curry served traditionally with a soft bread roll on the streets of mumbai. Traditionally a pav bhaji masala mix would be used but we simplified it by using some garam masala.

Method;
Roughly chop all the veg, deseed and chop the bell pepper. Finely chop the onion, garlic ginger and fresh chilli – removing the seeds and pith if you prefer less heat.
In a large saucepan add approx 1.5 litres water, 1 tbsp of the garam masala and 1 tbsp salt (don’t worry we will be draining the veg so much of the salt will go down the drain) and bring to a boil over high heat. Add to the pot the chopped cauliflower, bell pepper, carrots, peas and potato. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, this will take about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. You can also steam the veg if you prefer. This is a great recipe to use any leftover cooked veg you have in the fridge.
Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a wide non-stick pan over high heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, cumin seeds and pinch of salt, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, fresh chile, and around 100ml water, cook stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.
Stir in the tomato paste, red chile powder, turmeric, remaining 1 tablespoon garam masala and salt, cook, stirring constantly until mixture is the consistency of chunky tomato sauce, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add the drained cauliflower and potato mixture and in the pan mash well using a potato masher. Put back on the heat and mix well and simmer while you toast your bread.
In a separate pan, heat over medium heat, cut your roll in half and brush with a little oil and toast your bread roll in the hot pan for a few minutes each side until golden brown
Serve with your toasted rolls, finely diced red onion, lime or lemon wedges on the side and freshly chopped coriander.
